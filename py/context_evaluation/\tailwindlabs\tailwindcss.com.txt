Explanations: The context provides multiple excellent examples of responsive cards with box-shadows and text truncation. However, it lacks a direct example of applying a hover *scaling* effect to a card, which was a specific requirement. The user would need to combine concepts from the card snippets and the separate transform/scale snippets.
The provided context is almost entirely irrelevant to creating a responsive navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu. While it contains snippets about menus and sidebars, it does not offer a functional example or the necessary code structure to build this common component.
The context provides a complete and thorough answer. It includes snippets for applying dark mode styles with the `dark:` variant, configuring the strategy (class vs. media query), and the JavaScript necessary to create a user-toggled theme with `localStorage`.
The context only partially addresses the question. It provides useful snippets for styling form validation states (`:user-valid`, `:user-invalid`) but completely lacks examples of a multi-step form structure or progress indicators, which were the core requirements of the question.
This is an excellent response to the question. The context provides multiple high-quality examples using the recommended Headless UI library to build an accessible modal dialog. It covers creation, overlays, closing functionality, and even transitions.
The context thoroughly answers the question. It shows how to define a custom font using `@font-face` and how to add it to the theme using both the modern `@theme` directive and the older `tailwind.config.js` method. It also includes examples of applying the resulting font utility classes to elements.
The context provides a perfect answer, demonstrating the recommended approach using the Headless UI Transition component. It includes clear, copy-pasteable examples for both React and Vue that show how to create smooth slide-in and fade-out transitions for elements entering and leaving the DOM.
The context comprehensively covers this fundamental question. It provides multiple clear examples of creating responsive grids that change the number of columns across different breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, etc.), directly addressing all parts of the user's request.
The context directly and completely answers the question. It explicitly mentions and shows how to configure the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin and provides a clear example of how to style a form element (checkbox) with utility classes for a consistent look.
This is a perfect response. The context demonstrates how to extend the theme with custom brand colors using both the modern `@theme` directive and the `tailwind.config.js` file. It also shows how to use the newly created color utilities in HTML.
The context provides a strong foundation for creating complex animations. It includes examples of built-in animations (`animate-spin`), creating custom keyframe animations in the config, and even an example of a sequenced animation. While it doesn't provide a single 'multi-stage loading spinner' example, it equips the user with all the necessary tools and concepts.
The context offers a complete and efficient solution. It explains the importance of writing purge-friendly code by avoiding class name concatenation and demonstrates how to use the `safelist` option in the configuration for dynamic classes that cannot be statically analyzed.
This is an outstanding response. The context covers container queries in depth, from basic implementation (`@container`) and responsive variants (`@sm:`) to advanced features like named containers, max-width queries, range queries, and container query length units (`cqw`).
The context provides a perfect and direct answer. It includes a complete, high-quality example of a table with a sticky header and scrollable body, using only Tailwind CSS utility classes. The use of `sticky`, `top-0`, and `border-spacing-0` is clearly demonstrated.
The context directly answers how to create a custom plugin for reusable component classes. It shows the `plugin` function and the `addComponents` API, which are the exact tools needed for this task, and even demonstrates how to make these components responsive.
