Explanations: The context provides excellent, distinct examples for every feature requested in the responsive card component: responsive layouts, box-shadow utilities, hover effects for scaling, and text truncation. A developer could easily assemble the final component from these well-documented parts.
The context provides good foundational examples for a responsive navigation bar, including basic nav structures and using responsive prefixes like `md:flex` to change layouts. However, it lacks a complete, specific example of collapsing the menu into a hamburger icon and the associated JavaScript toggle, which is a key part of the question.
The context is weak in addressing this question. While it contains documentation for styling backdrops and general concepts of toggling classes with JavaScript, it completely lacks a specific example of a modal or dialog component structure. A user would need to build the entire component, including positioning and structure, from scratch with very little guidance.
The context provides excellent documentation on implementing a class-based dark mode strategy in Tailwind CSS and includes setup information for Next.js. However, it completely fails to mention the `next-themes` library, which is a specific requirement of the question. The user would have to adapt the generic JavaScript solution provided.
The context thoroughly covers Tailwind's responsive grid system (`grid-cols-*`, `md:grid-cols-*`), which is the core of the question. However, it does not provide any examples that specifically apply this system to a form layout with labels and input fields, which would have made it more directly applicable.
The context directly and comprehensively answers this question. It provides a perfect example of how to define custom `@keyframes` for an animation (like a 'wiggle' effect) and register it within the theme configuration, making it available as a utility class. This principle is directly transferable to a 'slide-in' effect.
The context perfectly answers the question with clear, direct examples. It shows exactly how to use the `@theme` directive to add both custom brand colors (e.g., `--color-regal-blue`) and custom font families (e.g., `--font-display`) to the configuration, which then become available as utility classes.
The context provides excellent guidance for this question. It explains how to organize custom CSS using the `@layer` directive for custom components and for styling third-party elements. It also includes several high-quality examples of creating reusable components in React and Vue, directly addressing the core of the user's request for large project organization.
The context almost completely fails to answer this question. It does not mention or explain the concept of purging, tree-shaking, or how Tailwind's JIT engine removes unused CSS in production builds. This is a critical feature for optimization that is entirely missing from the provided documentation.
The context provides primitives for building a responsive grid, which could be used for an image gallery layout. However, it is completely missing any information or examples related to creating a lightbox effect, which is a major and complex part of the question requiring JavaScript and modal-like functionality.
The context provides a perfect and comprehensive answer. It has multiple, clear examples of using both `group` variants (including named groups) for parent-state styling and `peer` variants (including named peers) for sibling-state styling, directly addressing both parts of the question.
The context provides a perfect and direct answer to this question. It includes a specific section on 'Adding custom styles for third-party components using @layer' and shows how to use the `@apply` directive to style selectors from an external library that cannot be modified directly.
The context provides strong building blocks to answer this. It shows how to create a custom utility like a container and separately provides numerous examples of applying responsive padding using breakpoint prefixes (e.g., `px-4 md:px-8`). While it doesn't show how to define responsive padding within the custom class definition itself, a user can easily achieve the goal by combining these two concepts in their HTML.
The context is very poor for this question. It does not mention the CSS `clamp()` function or the concept of fluid typography at all. The only remote clue is the documentation on arbitrary values, which a knowledgeable user might realize could be used to implement a clamp function (e.g., `text-[clamp(...)]`), but the context itself offers no guidance on how to do this.
The context provides a perfect and direct answer. It includes a specific example of using the `print:` variant to conditionally show and hide elements, which is exactly what is needed to create a print-specific layout. The example is clear and practical.
