/context7/tailwindcss,6.361702127659574,4.0,"[1, 5, 6]","Required and Unique Information: The snippets provided fail to include the majority of the required information. Only 2 of the 10 requested code examples were present (@import and basic utility class application). All snippets related to Vite configuration, responsive design, state variants, dark mode, flexbox, and grid were missing. Furthermore, there is an extremely high level of redundancy; many snippets are repeated verbatim (e.g., `npm run dev`) or are slight variations of the same content (e.g., multiple APIDOCs listing the same core concepts).
Clarity: While the titles and descriptions for individual snippets are generally clear and accurate, the overall collection is confusing due to massive repetition. The inclusion of many nearly identical snippets (like the APIDOC lists or the border color utilities) makes it difficult for a user to understand which information is important and clutters the result set unnecessarily.
Correct Syntax: The syntax within most code blocks is correct for the specified language. However, the score is reduced because several snippets use ellipses (`...`) as placeholders for other code or attributes. This directly violates the rule that snippets should not contain placeholders or ellipses, as it prevents the code from being easily isolated and used.","Percentage of code snippets with correct formatting: 6.382978723404255,

/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com,6.73015873015873,4.333333333333333,"[3, 4, 6]","Required and Unique Information: The snippets fail to cover many of the 10 specifically requested concepts (e.g., dark mode, `@apply`, theme extension/overrides, content source configuration). Over 20% of the snippets are entirely irrelevant to using Tailwind CSS (e.g., API documentation, VTT files, project metadata). There is also a high degree of repetition, with numerous snippets demonstrating the same ""utility-first"" concept with different properties, and several `APIDOC` snippets that all follow the same non-code, list-like format.
Clarity: Over half of the snippets have clarity issues. 15 snippets contain placeholders (`...`, `{token}`) which make them incomplete examples. Another 9 snippets use a custom `APIDOC` pseudo-language which is not a standard or runnable code format, making their purpose less clear than a concrete example. The remaining snippets have clear titles and descriptions.
Correct Syntax: While the syntax of the provided code is correct for the given languages, the criterion also requires that the code be easily isolatable, specifically mentioning ""no placeholders or ellipses"". 15 of the 42 snippets (over a third) violate this by including such placeholders, making them incomplete and not directly usable. The other snippets have correct and complete syntax.","Percentage of code snippets with correct formatting: 7.380952380952381,
