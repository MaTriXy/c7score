A developer could easily assemble the final component from these well-documented parts.', 'The context provides good foundational examples for a responsive navigation bar, including basic nav structures and using responsive prefixes like `md:flex` to change layouts. However, it lacks a complete, specific example of collapsing the menu into a hamburger icon and the associated JavaScript toggle, which is a key part of the question.', 'The context is weak in addressing this question. While it contains documentation for styling backdrops and general concepts of toggling classes with JavaScript, it completely lacks a specific example of a modal or dialog component structure. A user would need to build the entire component, including positioning and structure, from scratch with very little guidance.', 'The context provides excellent documentation on implementing a class-based dark mode strategy in Tailwind CSS and includes setup information for Next.js. However, it completely fails to mention the `next-themes` library, which is a specific requirement of the question. The user would have to adapt the generic JavaScript solution provided.', ""The context thoroughly covers Tailwind's responsive grid system (`grid-cols-*`, `md:grid-cols-*`), which is the core of the question. However, it does not provide any examples that specifically apply this system to a form layout with labels and input fields, which would have made it more directly applicable."", ""The context directly and comprehensively answers this question. It provides a perfect example of how to define custom `@keyframes` for an animation (like a 'wiggle' effect) and register it within the theme configuration, making it available as a utility class. This principle is directly transferable to a 'slide-in' effect."", 'The context perfectly answers the question with clear, direct examples. It shows exactly how to use the `@theme` directive to add both custom brand colors (e.g., `--color-regal-blue`) and custom font families (e.g., `--font-display`) to the configuration, which then become available as utility classes.', ""The context provides excellent guidance for this question. It explains how to organize custom CSS using the `@layer` directive for custom components and for styling third-party elements. It also includes several high-quality examples of creating reusable components in React and Vue, directly addressing the core of the user's request for large project organization."", ""The context almost completely fails to answer this question. It does not mention or explain the concept of purging, tree-shaking, or how Tailwind's JIT engine removes unused CSS in production builds. This is a critical feature for optimization that is entirely missing from the provided documentation."", 'The context provides primitives for building a responsive grid, which could be used for an image gallery layout. However, it is completely missing any information or examples related to creating a lightbox effect, which is a major and complex part of the question requiring JavaScript and modal-like functionality.', 'The context provides a perfect and comprehensive answer. It has multiple, clear examples of using both `group` variants (including named groups) for parent-state styling and `peer` variants (including named peers) for sibling-state styling, directly addressing both parts of the question.', ""The context provides a perfect and direct answer to this question. It includes a specific section on 'Adding custom styles for third-party components using @layer' and shows how to use the `@apply` directive to style selectors from an external library that cannot be modified directly."", ""The context provides strong building blocks to answer this. It shows how to create a custom utility like a container and separately provides numerous examples of applying responsive padding using breakpoint prefixes (e.g., `px-4 md:px-8`). While it doesn't show how to define responsive padding within the custom class definition itself, a user can easily achieve the goal by combining these two concepts in their HTML."", 'The context is very poor for this question. It does not mention the CSS `clamp()` function or the concept of fluid typography at all. The only remote clue is the documentation on arbitrary values, which a knowledgeable user might realize could be used to implement a clamp function (e.g., `text-[clamp(...)]`), but the context itself offers no guidance on how to do this.', 'The context provides a perfect and direct answer. It includes a specific example of using the `print:` variant to conditionally show and hide elements, which is exactly what is needed to create a print-specific layout. The example is clear and practical.']",72,"Unique Information (30%):
Many snippets are highly redundant. For example, there are 11 snippets for the `npm run dev` command, many with only slightly different contexts. Similarly, four `APIDOC` snippets list the same getting started/core concepts, and there are three identical snippets each for creating a Vite project (`npm create vite...`) and installing the Tailwind Vite plugin (`npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite`). While some contextual differences exist, the amount of repetition is significant, reducing the overall score. About a third of the snippets are duplicates or near-duplicates of others.

Clarity (30%):
The snippets are generally clear and in English. However, there are several issues. Some snippets have mismatched `LANGUAGE` tags (e.g., `HTML` for Handlebars code, `json` for a JavaScript object, `npm` for shell commands), which is confusing. One snippet (14) has a typo in the command (`webcd` instead of `web cd`). Another snippet (24) has its JavaScript code formatted as a single, long, unreadable line. Snippet 21 uses a command (`npx sv create`) that is likely incorrect for creating a SvelteKit project, causing confusion.

Correct Syntax (40%):
There are several syntax-related problems. Multiple snippets use incorrect `LANGUAGE` identifiers (`APIDOC`, `npm`, `json` for a JS object). Snippet 14 contains an invalid shell command due to a missing space (`webcd`). Snippet 15 presents a JavaScript object literal but incorrectly labels it as `json` and fails to use double quotes for keys, making it invalid JSON. Snippet 21 uses a command (`npx sv create`) that appears to be syntactically incorrect for the described action. While most snippets are correct, these errors are notable.","Snippets are complete and formatted correctly: 53.65853658536586,

However, it lacks a direct example of applying a hover *scaling* effect to a card, which was a specific requirement. The user would need to combine concepts from the card snippets and the separate transform/scale snippets.', 'The provided context is almost entirely irrelevant to creating a responsive navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu. While it contains snippets about menus and sidebars, it does not offer a functional example or the necessary code structure to build this common component.', 'The context provides a complete and thorough answer. It includes snippets for applying dark mode styles with the `dark:` variant, configuring the strategy (class vs. media query), and the JavaScript necessary to create a user-toggled theme with `localStorage`.', 'The context only partially addresses the question.

The context provides multiple high-quality examples using the recommended Headless UI library to build an accessible modal dialog. It covers creation, overlays, closing functionality, and even transitions.', 'The context thoroughly answers the question. It shows how to define a custom font using `@font-face` and how to add it to the theme using both the modern `@theme` directive and the older `tailwind.config.js` method. It also includes examples of applying the resulting font utility classes to elements.', 'The context provides a perfect answer, demonstrating the recommended approach using the Headless UI Transition component. It includes clear, copy-pasteable examples for both React and Vue that show how to create smooth slide-in and fade-out transitions for elements entering and leaving the DOM.', ""The context comprehensively covers this fundamental question. It provides multiple clear examples of creating responsive grids that change the number of columns across different breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, etc.), directly addressing all parts of the user's request."", 'The context directly and completely answers the question. It explicitly mentions and shows how to configure the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin and provides a clear example of how to style a form element (checkbox) with utility classes for a consistent look.', 'This is a perfect response. The context demonstrates how to extend the theme with custom brand colors using both the modern `@theme` directive and the `tailwind.config.js` file. It also shows how to use the newly created color utilities in HTML.', ""The context provides a strong foundation for creating complex animations. It includes examples of built-in animations (`animate-spin`), creating custom keyframe animations in the config, and even an example of a sequenced animation. While it doesn't provide a single 'multi-stage loading spinner' example, it equips the user with all the necessary tools and concepts."", 'The context offers a complete and efficient solution. It explains the importance of writing purge-friendly code by avoiding class name concatenation and demonstrates how to use the `safelist` option in the configuration for dynamic classes that cannot be statically analyzed.', 'This is an outstanding response. The context covers container queries in depth, from basic implementation (`@container`) and responsive variants (`@sm:`) to advanced features like named containers, max-width queries, range queries, and container query length units (`cqw`).', 'The context provides a perfect and direct answer. It includes a complete, high-quality example of a table with a sticky header and scrollable body, using only Tailwind CSS utility classes. The use of `sticky`, `top-0`, and `border-spacing-0` is clearly demonstrated.', 'The context directly answers how to create a custom plugin for reusable component classes. It shows the `plugin` function and the `addComponents` API, which are the exact tools needed for this task, and even demonstrates how to make these components responsive.']",73,"Unique Information (80/100): Most snippets provide unique information, covering a wide range of topics from installation commands to component examples. However, there is some repetition. Several snippets are for `npm install`, with two for `tailwindcss@latest` being nearly identical. Additionally, there are pairs of snippets where one shows a full React JSX implementation and another shows a simplified, abbreviated HTML version of the same concept (e.g., table border spacing), which reduces the overall uniqueness.
Clarity (80/100): The majority of snippets have clear titles and descriptions. However, clarity is reduced in many cases by the use of ellipses (`...`) and placeholders in the code, which obscure the full implementation. One snippet is confusing because its title mentions a specific version (`v2.2`) while the code uses `@latest`. Another snippet contains incomplete HTML, making its structure difficult to understand.
Correct Syntax (62/100): A significant number of snippets violate the rule against placeholders and ellipses. At least 13 snippets contain `...`, `<!-- ... -->`, or `// ...` within their code blocks, making them incomplete examples. One snippet contains a clear syntax error with unclosed HTML tags. Another minor issue is the inclusion of the `$` shell prompt character, which is not part of the command.","Snippets are complete and formatted correctly: 56.41025641025641,
