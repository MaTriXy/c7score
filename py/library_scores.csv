/upstash/context7,8.101503759398495,6.875,"The snippets cover most of the required information, but are missing the point about advanced Node.js troubleshooting and only partially cover Docker implementation and running locally.
There is an extreme amount of snippet duplication. Many snippets providing JSON configurations for various editors are completely identical, as are several other snippets showing command-line usage or Docker configurations.
Several snippets are unclear due to language issues. Two snippets use a Cyrillic 'C' in the JSON key ""Ð¡ontext7"", which is very confusing. Other snippets have titles and descriptions in Japanese and Turkish.
Several snippets that are supposed to be JSON are not valid, complete JSON objects but are instead fragments (e.g., a single key-value pair without the surrounding curly braces).
Multiple snippets contain placeholders that prevent the code from being isolated and run directly, such as `<CLIENT_NAME>`, `<YOUR_SMITHERY_KEY>`, and `/path/to/folder/`.
Titles and descriptions are consistently sensible and accurately describe their corresponding code snippets.
The programming language assigned to each snippet is correct and appropriate for the code's content.
Several snippets contain non-English text. There are titles and descriptions in Turkish and Japanese, a file path in Spanish, and Cyrillic characters used in code.","Percentage of required components satisfied (represented as score out of 10): 10.0
