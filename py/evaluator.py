        was partially met, and 10 is the criterion was fully met
        with no room for improvement. Each criterion
        compares the required information with the snippets.
        The snippets are separated by 
        {snippet_del}
        and the code blocks are enclosed in ```.
        Your scores should represent a ratio of how many
        snippets meet the criterion out of the total number of snippets.
        The maximum possible total score is 80 and the minimum is 0.
        Refrain from giving a score between 0-5 for any criterion unless there is an extreme or frequent case.
        
        Criteria:
        1. The snippets include some variation of all the required information. It does not need to be exact, but should
        convery the same idea.
        2. Snippets contain unique information that is not already included in another snippet. There can be some overlap, but
        the snippets should not be identical.
        3. There are no snippets that are confusingly worded or unclear. This could be grammatical or spelling errors.
        4. No snippets contain any obvious syntax errors.
        5. Snippets are formatted in such a way that you can easily isolate the code (e.g., no placeholders or ellipses).
        6. Titles and descriptions are sensible (e.g., the description shouldn't be about requests when the code is about
        visualizing data).
        7. The programming language of the code snippet is correct.
        8. All the text, even in the code snippets, are in English.

        Return only the JSON object with this schema:
        {{
            "scores": [int, ..., int],  # Has length of 8, each element is a score between 0 and 10
