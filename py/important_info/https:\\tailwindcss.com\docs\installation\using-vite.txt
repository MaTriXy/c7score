1.  ### Vite Plugin Configuration
    To integrate Tailwind CSS into a Vite project, you need to add the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to your Vite configuration file. This plugin is the most seamless way to use Tailwind CSS with frameworks like Laravel, SvelteKit, React Router, Nuxt, and SolidJS. The following code should be added to your `vite.config.ts` file.

    ```ts
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
    import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [
        tailwindcss(),
      ],
    })
    ```

2.  ### Importing Tailwind CSS
    After configuring the Vite plugin, you need to import the Tailwind CSS styles into your project. This is done by adding an `@import` rule to your main CSS file. This directive will import all of the necessary Tailwind CSS styles into your project.

    ```css
    @import "tailwindcss";
    ```

3.  ### Basic Usage in HTML
    Once Tailwind CSS is configured, you can start using its utility classes directly in your HTML to style your content. For example, you can use classes like `text-3xl`, `font-bold`, and `underline` to style a heading. The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler will then generate the corresponding CSS.

    ```html
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Hello world!
    </h1>
    ```

4.  ### Content Source Configuration
    To ensure that Tailwind CSS generates all the necessary utility classes, you need to configure the paths to all of your template files. This is typically done in a `tailwind.config.js` file, by setting the `content` property. This tells Tailwind where to look for class names.

5.  ### Theme Customization with @theme
    In Tailwind CSS v4, you can define your theme directly in your CSS file using the `@theme` directive. This allows you to customize your design system, including colors, fonts, and spacing, without needing a separate configuration file.

6.  ### Just-In-Time (JIT) Engine
    Tailwind CSS uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that generates your CSS on-demand by scanning your template files for class names. This means that only the CSS that you are actually using will be generated, resulting in a smaller final CSS file. This makes the development cycle feel incredibly light.

7.  ### Tailwind CSS Directives
    Tailwind CSS provides several directives that you can use in your CSS. The `@tailwind` directive is used to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles into your CSS. This is an alternative to using `@import "tailwindcss";`.

8.  ### Using `tailwind.config.js` for Older Versions
    While Tailwind CSS v4 encourages defining styles directly in CSS, you can still use a `tailwind.config.js` file for configuration. This is useful for backward compatibility with older versions or for more complex configurations.

9.  ### PostCSS Configuration
    When you initialize Tailwind CSS, a `postcss.config.js` file is often created. This file is used to configure PostCSS plugins, such as `autoprefixer`, which adds vendor prefixes to your CSS for better browser compatibility.

10. ### Utility-First Fundamentals
    The core concept of Tailwind CSS is to use utility classes to build your designs directly in your HTML. This allows for rapid prototyping and development, as you can apply styles without having to switch between your HTML and CSS files. The classes are designed to be small and composable, allowing you to create complex designs with a limited set of utilities.
