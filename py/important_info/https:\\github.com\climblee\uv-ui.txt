Google search results: Here is a list of the most crucial technical information for using the `uv-ui` library:

1.  **Component Implementation**
    After installing the `uv-ui` library and configuring `uni_modules`, its components can be used in your project without needing to be manually imported or registered in each file. This simplifies the development process by allowing for direct implementation in the template.
    ```vue
    <template> 
      <uv-icon name="baidu" size="30" color="#909399"></uv-icon> 
    </template>
    ```

2.  **Broad Platform Compatibility**
    `uv-ui` is a versatile UI framework designed to work across a wide range of platforms. It is compatible with Vue 2 and Vue 3, and can be used for developing web apps (H5), mobile apps (for both iOS and Android), and various Mini Programs. This cross-platform support is built upon the `uni-app` framework.

3.  **Extensive Component Library**
    The framework offers a comprehensive list of ready-to-use components that cover many common UI needs. Some of the key components include `uv-skeletons` for loading states, `uv-calendars` for date selection, `uv-form` for form handling, and `uv-input` for text input. The library also includes components for layout, navigation, feedback, and more.

4.  **Extended Functionality Configuration**
    `uv-ui` includes a suite of utility functions and tools, such as a request library, that are not enabled by default. To use these features, you must create an extension configuration that makes them available throughout your project. This allows you to access them via a global object, such as `uni.$uv`.

5.  **`nvue` Compatibility**
    A significant feature of `uv-ui` is its enhanced compatibility with `nvue`, which is `uni-app`'s native rendering engine. The library was developed to address limitations of its predecessor, `uView2.x`, where certain components were not usable in `nvue` environments.

6.  **Form Handling Components**
    The library provides a set of components specifically for building forms, which includes `uv-form`, `uv-input`, `uv-textarea`, `uv-checkbox`, `uv-radio`, and `uv-switch`. These components are designed to work together to create robust and interactive forms in your applications.

7.  **Feedback and Notification Components**
    `uv-ui` includes a variety of components for providing feedback to the user. This includes `uv-toast` for brief messages, `uv-notice-bar` for scrolling notifications, `uv-modal` for dialogs, and `uv-alert` for warning messages.

8.  **Layout and Navigation**
    The framework provides powerful tools for structuring your application's layout and navigation. Key components include `uv-row` for creating grid-based layouts, `uv-navbar` for custom navigation bars, and `uv-tabbar` for bottom navigation.

9.  **Asynchronous and Loading UI**
    `uv-ui` offers several components to handle asynchronous operations and loading states. The `uv-skeletons` component provides a modern skeleton screen, `uv-loading-icon` and `uv-loading-page` display loading animations, and `uv-load-more` can be used to indicate that more content is being loaded.

10. **Rich Content Display**
    The library includes components for displaying various types of content. `uv-parse` is used for parsing and displaying rich text content, `uv-image` is for displaying images, and `uv-qrcode` can be used to generate and display QR codes.
