== Context Explanations ==

The context is highly relevant, providing a complete example of a dropdown menu, which is a core part of the question. The code quality is excellent and shows a real-world implementation. However, it uses a specific library (`@tailwindplus/elements`) and doesn't explicitly demonstrate the responsive 'hamburger' toggle for mobile screens, which slightly lowers its direct applicability and feature coverage.,This context is exceptionally helpful. It includes snippets for styling a native HTML `<dialog>` element's backdrop and using `@supports` queries for effects like `backdrop-blur`. This directly addresses how to create a modal with a semi-transparent overlay. The code is high-quality, practical, and covers all requested features.,The context provides an almost perfect answer. It contains several highly relevant snippets, including a complete, responsive form example with custom-styled inputs, labels, and state variants (`focus`, `invalid`). It also includes a submit button with a `hover` effect, covering all aspects of the question with high-quality, applicable code.,This context is outstanding. The 'Responsive Marketing Page Component' is a perfect example of a product card, containing an image, text content, and a link that can serve as a call-to-action. The code is clean, practical, and demonstrates a real-world implementation of the requested component.,This context is a perfect match for the question. It provides a complete JavaScript solution for a theme toggle that uses `localStorage` to persist the user's choice. It also includes the necessary `tailwind.config.js` setup and examples of `dark:` utility classes, covering every aspect of the request comprehensively.,The context is highly relevant and useful. It provides specific examples for configuring `purge` in `tailwind.config.js`, setting up the JIT engine, and transforming content before purging. This directly addresses the question about minimizing production build size with clear, practical configuration snippets.,The context is very helpful. It provides several examples of adding custom colors and fonts using the modern `@theme` directive in CSS. While the question specifically mentioned `tailwind.config.js`, these snippets show the current best practice for theme customization, which is highly applicable and relevant to the user's goal.,This context provides a perfect answer. It includes an API reference for transition properties, configuration examples for setting default transition duration and easing, and an HTML example showing how to apply transition classes. It covers the topic from all angles with high clarity.,This context is perfectly suited to the question. It includes multiple snippets demonstrating how to create responsive grids using `grid-cols-*` utilities combined with breakpoint prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`). The examples are clear, directly applicable, and show exactly how to change the number of columns at different screen sizes.,The context is excellent. It includes specific snippets for styling disabled elements using the `disabled:` variant, overriding hover effects on disabled buttons, and applying a `cursor-not-allowed` style. The complete form example also showcases these states in action, providing a comprehensive solution.,The context perfectly answers the question. It provides multiple high-quality examples of using the `group-hover` variant to style child elements (like an icon or text) when a parent element (the button) is hovered. The code is clear, practical, and demonstrates the exact technique requested.,This context is highly relevant. It provides excellent examples of defining custom `@keyframes` (like a 'wiggle' effect) and associating them with animation utilities using the `@theme` directive. While the question mentions `tailwind.config.js`, this demonstrates the modern and recommended approach, making it very applicable.,The context provides a perfect and comprehensive answer. It includes a clear example of using `@apply` to combine utilities into a component class like `.btn`. It also shows how to structure these custom classes within `@layer components`, which is the best practice.,This context is a perfect match. It contains multiple examples using the `peer-*` variants (`peer-checked`, `peer-focus`) to style a sibling element based on an input's state. The floating label example is particularly illustrative of the power of this feature. The code is clear, high-quality, and directly answers the question.,The context perfectly addresses the question. It includes specific snippets showing how to apply a custom background image using `bg-[url(...)]` and how to control its repetition with classes like `bg-repeat`. This combination provides a direct and complete solution.

== LLM Explanation ==

The first set of snippets provides high-quality, diverse examples. 
1. Unique Information (90/100): The snippets are overwhelmingly unique, covering a wide range of functionalities from installation commands for different versions to complex component examples in JSX, Vue, and MDX. There is a minor issue with two pairs of snippets being identical, but the overall information diversity is very high.
2. Clarity (85/100): Titles and descriptions are clear and accurately reflect the code. The main drawback is the occasional mislabeling of the programming language. For example, a Vue component is incorrectly labeled as `HTML`, and some JSX snippets are labeled as `javascript`.
3. Correct Syntax (80/100): The code is mostly correct. However, several HTML/JSX snippets use `...` as a placeholder within class attributes, which violates the criterion of not using placeholders. One Webpack configuration snippet is also not self-contained as it relies on an undefined custom function.
