== Context Explanations ==

Provides multiple highly relevant examples, including a full card component (`Responsive Marketing Page Component`), how to define a `.card` class, and specific utilities for `box-shadow` and `truncate`. It covers all requested features well. The code is practical and clear.,The "Build a Custom Dropdown" snippet is highly relevant and provides a complete, functional example using a library. While not a full navigation bar, it's the most complex part. It also includes info on responsive breakpoints. It's a good starting point but not a complete solution.,Provides excellent snippets on how to enable media-based dark mode (`darkMode: "media"`) and how to apply dark variant styles (`dark:`). However, it doesn't cover the "toggle" aspect which usually requires `darkMode: "class"` or a similar strategy, nor does it mention Next.js integration specifically.,The `Implement a modal dialog with Headless UI React Dialog` snippet is a perfect answer. It uses a recommended accessibility-first library, shows state management, and the `onClose` prop implicitly handles closing on Esc or outside clicks, fulfilling all parts of the query.,Offers a comprehensive set of snippets covering form styling, the forms plugin, and critically, validation states using `user-invalid` and `peer-invalid` to show/hide error messages. It covers all aspects of the question with high-quality, practical examples.,Provides excellent tools for this task. The `React Headless UI Transition` component is a high-level solution for enter/leave animations, and the `Applying Translation Transforms` snippet shows the low-level utilities needed for the "slide" effect. This combination provides a complete and practical solution.,The snippet on the JIT engine is key, as JIT is the modern and efficient way Tailwind handles purging by default. The inclusion of the `safelist` configuration snippet addresses important edge cases, making this a very thorough answer to optimizing CSS.,Provides exhaustive coverage. It shows the modern `@theme` directive approach for both colors and fonts, as well as the older `tailwind.config.js` method. It's comprehensive, clear, and demonstrates multiple valid ways to achieve the goal.,The `Create responsive grid column layouts` snippet is a direct and perfect answer, showing the exact class combination (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-6`) needed. It's supported by docs on breakpoints and an important tip about mobile-first design.,Provides two perfect, best-practice solutions. The `Conditionally apply` snippet shows simple ternary logic, and the `Mapping props to static class names` snippet shows a robust pattern for managing multiple variants that is highly recommended by the Tailwind team.,Fully answers the question by showing two ways to create custom animations: the modern `@theme` with `@keyframes` approach and the traditional `tailwind.config.js` extension. The code is clear and directly applicable.,The context provides the basic tools for `z-index` (the API doc and how to apply negative values) but fails to address the core of the question about the "best approach for managing... in a large application." It lacks discussion of strategies like isolation contexts or using CSS variables for a token-based system.,Provides multiple, clear examples of styling `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, including how to set their content. The examples are practical and directly answer the user's question.,The `Create HTML Table with Sticky Headers` snippet is a flawless answer. It provides a complete, working example of a table with a sticky header, explaining the necessary `border-separate` and `sticky` classes.,This context correctly answers this advanced question by providing an example of the `:has()` pseudo-class. Although the example uses `has-[:checked]`, it perfectly illustrates the modern CSS technique required to style a parent based on a child's state, which can be adapted for `:hover`.

Snippets 1 had an average score of 85.5 and Snippets 2 had an average score of 58.0.

**Snippets 1 (Score: 85.5/100):**
*   **Unique Information (85/100):** The snippets cover a very wide and diverse range of topics, from shell commands and component examples to configuration files and content formats like VTT and MDX. However, there were a few instances of direct duplication (e.g., `npm install -D tailwindcss@latest` appeared twice, and a set of three installation commands was repeated), which slightly lowered the score.
*   **Clarity (100/100):** All snippets were exceptionally clear. Titles and descriptions accurately reflected the code content. There were no grammatical errors, and all text was in English. The language tags were appropriate for the code provided.
*   **Correct Syntax (75/100):** The syntax for the code in most snippets was correct. However, the score was reduced because a significant number of HTML and Vue snippets (8 out of 32) included placeholders like `...` or `// ...`, which violates the criterion of having no placeholders or ellipses.

**Snippets 2 (Score: 58.0/100):**
*   **Unique Information (40/100):** This set suffers from a very high degree of repetition. The command `npm run dev` is repeated 10 times, and several other commands and concepts (like creating a Vite project or the APIDOC lists) are duplicated multiple times. This severely impacts the uniqueness of the information provided.
*   **Clarity (60/100):** Clarity was mixed. While many snippets were clear, the repetitive `npm run dev` snippets used different descriptions for different frameworks without the code reflecting that context. Additionally, four snippets were tagged as `APIDOC` and contained lists of topics rather than code. Some snippets were poorly formatted, hindering readability.
*   **Correct Syntax (70/100):** The score was penalized primarily because several snippets were tagged with non-standard or incorrect languages (e.g., `APIDOC`, `npm`). The four `APIDOC` snippets are not code and thus fail the criterion. While most code was syntactically valid, the poor formatting in some cases made it difficult to parse easily. On the positive side, this set did not use placeholders like `...`.
