  "Question 1": "Show me how to use the `pipeline` function in transformers to set up a zero-shot text classification model and use it to categorize a list of product reviews with custom labels.",
  "Question 2": "How can I load a pre-trained BERT model and its tokenizer, and then fine-tune it on my own CSV dataset for a sentiment analysis task?",
  "Question 3": "Provide a step-by-step guide to building a simple conversational chatbot using a generative model like GPT-2 from the transformers library.",
  "Question 4": "What is the correct way to handle text inputs that are longer than the model's maximum sequence length? Demonstrate the sliding window or truncation strategy.",

  "Question 6": "Generate the code to optimize a standard transformer model for inference by converting it to the ONNX format.",
  "Question 7": "How do I extract the hidden state embeddings for each token in a sentence using a pre-trained model like RoBERTa?",
  "Question 8": "Show me how to implement a custom training loop for a transformer model in PyTorch without using the `Trainer` class to have more control over the training process.",
  "Question 9": "What is the best way to batch-process a list of texts for inference to maximize throughput on a GPU?",
  "Question 10": "How can I properly format a prompt for a text generation model to perform a few-shot learning task, providing examples within the prompt itself?",
