Here are the top 10 most important pieces of information from the provided files:

---
**1. Project Description and Core Features**
98.css is a design system for building faithful recreations of old user interfaces. It is a CSS-only file, meaning it ships without any JavaScript and is compatible with any frontend framework. Its purpose is to take semantic HTML and style it to look like classic UIs, such as Windows 98. Visual examples show a typical Windows 98 dialog window and highlight pixel-perfect borders.

**2. CDN Installation and Basic Usage Example (HTML Head)**
The easiest way to use 98.css is by importing it directly from unpkg via a `<link>` tag in your HTML `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/98.css" />
```

---
**3. Basic HTML Structure Example for UI Components**
To apply the 98.css styles, you use specific class names on semantic HTML elements. Here's an example of the basic structure for a window component:

```html
<div class="window" style="margin: 32px; width: 250px">
  <div class="title-bar">
    <div class="title-bar-text">
      My First VB4 Program
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="window-body">
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
